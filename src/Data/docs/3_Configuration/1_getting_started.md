# Configurations

- ## Config File:

Before starting to compiling & executing anything, lets take a look at runnr.conf file present at:-
```bash
Windows: C:\Users\<user-name>\runnr.conf
Unix-like: ~\.config\runnr.conf
```

>If config file is not present the try running: runnr --version

This runnr.conf is the main config file that runnr use to execute commands based on file-extension. Once the configuration is set for any file-extension runnr can execute and run it without any problem. As runnr is a config file based tool, it is very easy to use the same config file in different system only after setting it up once.
